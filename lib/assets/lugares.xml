R$1,00 por período de até 5 horas, com seguro. O estacionamento funciona 24hs, independe do shopping. É anotado o RG e você recebe um ticket comprovante. Os paraciclos(prendem só a roda da frente) estão no piso G1, área VIP onde fica a gerência do estacionamento. E dá muita segurança, a mesa do responsável pelo piso fica à 10 m das bikes. Lá tem corrente já(embora pequena só prenda a roda da frente), é só levar o cadeado. Ideal é levar sua corrente maior e envolver o quadro e a roda juntos. A entrada deve ser feita pelo elevador de serviço do shopping, acessível pela entrada da rua Pedro de Toledo, é só abordar o segurança e perguntar pelo elevador, e nunca usar a rampa de carros pra subir ou descer os pisos.<br>&nbsp;<br>O gerente Marcelo disse que será feita uma reforma e ficará ainda melhor, me convidou para visitar e aprovar num teste gratuito depois de pronto, foi muito receptivo e interessado quando eu disse que estava relacionando estabelecimentos onde frequento simpáticos à causa da bicicleta-transporte e que seriam publicados na internet. Eu elogiei a atenção que recebi, desde o segurança lá embaixo ao gerente, me surpreendi positivamente.<br>&nbsp;<br>Márcio Campos<br>]]></description>
